Facts
Fungi play a highly vital role in the environment.
The combined weight of ants is higher than humans.
"The world’s oldest tress are 4,600 year old Bristlecone pines in the USA."
Paper from trees can be recycled 6 times.
Aluminium can be recycled forever.
Carbon dioxide is the most prominent greenhouse gases.
Water vapor is the most potent of the greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere.
"Methane is more potent than carbon dioxide, but exists in far lower concentrations in the atmosphere."
The main cause of ozone layer depletion is chlorofluorocarbons of CFCs.
CFC emissions have stopped since 2010 under the Montreal Protocol.
An endangered species is one whose numbers are so small that it is at risk of extinction.
Extinction is a natural phenomenon and occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to five species per year.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) strives to recover species from the endangered list by restoring their ecological health until they no longer need protection.
There will be more plastic in our oceans than fish by 2050.
The most pressing environmental concern regarding landfills is their release of methane gas. As the organic mass in landfills decompose methane gas is released.
"40 percent of plastic produced is packaging, used just once and then discarded; Shoppers in the U.S use almost one per resident per day, and shoppers in Denmark use an average of four plastic bags a year."
Single-use plastics are illegal in some parts of the world: Kenya introduced one of the world’s toughest laws against plastic bags in 2017.
"The average person eats 70,000 micro plastics each year."
"Thousands of seabirds and sea turtles, seals, and other marine mammals are killed each year after ingesting plastic or getting entangled it."
"There are point source pollution and non-point source pollution that causes eutrophication: Pollution from contaminants that enter a waterway from a single identifiable source is called point source pollution, and pollution from widespread with no specific identifiable point of discharge or entry into receiving watercourses is called non-point source pollution."
Eutrophication is predominantly caused by highly used nitrate and phosphate fertilizers.
"When aquatic ecosystems experience increased nutrients due to eutrophication, algal blooms grow excessively and limit the amount of dissolved oxygen required for respiration by other animal and plant species in the water, thus, threatening the survival of fish and other aquatic life."
"Over 97 percent of the earth’s water is found in the oceans; two percent of the earth’s water is stored as fresh water in glaciers, ice caps, and snowy mountain ranges; and that leaves only one percent of the earth’s water available to us for our daily water supply needs."
Most of our drinking water comes from rivers and streams.
The ocean absorbs most of the heat we produce: ocean had sucked up 90% of the heat was gained by the plant between 1971 and 2010.
Global Warming is (partially) reversible.
Climate change is creating a refugee crisis.
We use more of the earth’s resources than it can renew.
Electric motors makes vehicles substantially more efficient than internal combustion engines.
"There is a correlation between human’s health issues such as Brian health, obesity, diabetes, and cancer and chemical additives that leach from plastics."
"The average person eats, drinks, and breathes between 74,000 and 114,000 micro plastic particles every year."
People eat five grams of micro and nano plastics every week.
"In 2020, renewable energy sources, including wind, hydroelectric, solar biomass, and geothermal energy, generated 21% of all the electricity generated the United States."
The biggest hindrance to the development of renewable energy is its cost and infrastructure.
About 30 percent of the world’s electricity comes from renewables and the demand for energy is growing fast.
Norway is the country with the highest share of renewable energy in the world in 2021.
"Energy Policy suggest that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2050 is both possible and affordable, but requires political support."
"Out of all energy resources, green power( solar, wind, biomass and geothermal) is the cleanest form of energy."
Bees are part of the biodiversity  on which we all depend for our survival as they provide high-quality food.
Bees pollinate a third of our food.
"Cap-and -trade is a system that limits aggregate emissions from a group of emitters by setting a “cap” on maximum emissions, and countries could sell the right to emit greenhouse gases to other countries that needed it."
"Leachate is the liquid produced in landfill sites and can become toxic and thus contaminate nearby streams, ponds and lakes, damaging the habitat of many different organism."
Ocean acidification occurs due to the massive amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean and dissolving in seawater as carbonic acid.
"As ocean acidification reduces the amount of carbonate, it makes more difficult for marine organisms, such as coral and some plankton, to form their shells and skeletons."
"The most effective way to limit ocean acidification is to act on climate change, implementing solutions to dramatically reduce the use of fossil fuels."
The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide that is released in the atmosphere.
"The largest reservoir of the Earth’s carbon is located in the deep-ocean, with 37,000 billion tons of carbon stored, whereas approximately 65,500 billion tons are found in the globe."
At least half of Earth’s oxygen comes from the ocean and they produce more oxygen than the largest redwoods.
Peepal Tree is the most popular oxygen-producing tree which emits oxygen in the air.
Tulsi is one of the plants that give out oxygen at night.
"Disadvantages of an electric car are finding charging stations, charging times, and higher initial costs."
Electric cars’ batteries can be recycled once materials have been recovered.
"Direct causes of deforestation are agricultural expansion, wood extraction, and infrastructure expansion such as road building and urbanization."
Soil erosion removes the fertile top layer of the soil and exposes the hard rocky lower layers which are less fertile and have less humus.
Desertificaition is the process of land turning into desert as the quality of the oil declines over time. 
One of the main causes of desertification is population growth as an increased population is putting greater pressure on the environment for resources such as wood and water.
